# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I've been working on the FreeCodeCamp curriculum since I caught wind of this challenge, but I will start couting today (5-Jan-17) as day 1.

### Day 1: 5-Jan-2017 (1030 - 1230 CST)

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp Basic JavaScript Exercises. Start: Build JavaScript Objects. End: Iterate with JavaScript While Loops

**Thoughts** I've come back to coding after a break. Some of the stuff is as fresh as they day I learned it, other things not so much. I got hung up on the Manipulating Complex Objects Exercise because *commas* separate *everything* in an object. Additionally, remembering how nesting loops work hung me up for a while on the Nesting For Loops exercise where the end goal was to get a product based on all the array elements, in multiple arrays. I will hopefully come back later today and work on the mini-project section [Profile Lookup](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/profile-lookup) to close up the objects and loops portion of the Basic JavaScript Exercises.
