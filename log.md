# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I've been working on the FreeCodeCamp curriculum since I caught wind of this challenge, but I will start couting today (5-Jan-17) as day 1.

### Day 1: 5-Jan-2017 (1030 - 1230 CST)

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp Basic JavaScript Exercises. Start: Build JavaScript Objects. End: Iterate with JavaScript While Loops

**Thoughts** I've come back to coding after a break. Some of the stuff is as fresh as they day I learned it, other things not so much. I got hung up on the Manipulating Complex Objects Exercise because *commas* separate *everything* in an object. Additionally, remembering how nesting loops work hung me up for a while on the Nesting For Loops exercise where the end goal was to get a product based on all the array elements, in multiple arrays. I will hopefully come back later today and work on the mini-project section [Profile Lookup](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/profile-lookup) to close up the objects and loops portion of the Basic JavaScript Exercises.

### Day 2: 6-Jan-2017 (0900 - 1020 1200-1215 CST)

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp Basic JavaScript Exercises. Finished: Profile Lookup and the rest of the Basic JavaScript Exercises

**Thoughts** You ever run in to a wall? That's what I did on the FreeCodeCamp Profile Lookup exercise, which I tried to tackle for a bit yesterday evening, and finally finished today. I knew logically how it needed to happen, but I could not translate the logic in my brain to logic that JavaScript would understand. I went on the [JavaScript Help](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/HelpJavaScript) gitter last night and got some help from @revisualize, but I couldn't make the final connection before I went to sleep last night. This morning, I tried several tacts (while loops, lookup array) and couldn't get it to work. On the JavaScript Help Gitter, someone has having the same problem that I was and I read through that persons code and their correspondence with another user and was able to find where I went astray, and where they went astray and was able to fix those two errors to complete my code. My thanks to them, unfortunately, I do not remember their user names, or I would mention them.

### Day 3: 7-Jan-17 (1930 - 2115 CST)

**Today's Progress**: Eloquent JavaScript Chapter 2 Programs

**Thoughts** Not a lot today. I was trying to make some repairs to my laptop, which went well until I tried to put it back together the 2nd time and the power button's connection on the main board came lose from its mainboard mount, so now I have to see if it is more cost effective to replace the mainboard or see if someone can do some surface mount soldering on that issue.

At any rate, I have been reading Eloquent JavaScript, and dove into the Chapter 2 programs this evening to keep current on program flows. The chapter 2 programs involved outputting [octothorpes](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/octothorpe) in a right triangle as follows

\#

\#\#

\#\#\#

\#\#\#\#
etc.

Also did the "FizzBuzz" program where you write a program that outputs Fizz for multiples 3 and Buzz for multiples of 5, FizzBuzz for numbers that are multiples of 3 and 5, and just the number for anything that did not meet those criteria.

The last program in chapter 2 was the chessboard problem wher you programatically get the console to out put "#" or " " in an alternating fashion over multiple rows *a la* a chess board. This is a program I had done in the past, but I couldn't remember how I had done it so it took me much longer to complete than I'd like to admit, but I got it done. This also served as a lesson, save your code snippets, no matter how insiginifcant, as they will provide a good resource for the stupid simple thing you forgot to do in your big program.

Lastly, so far, I can highly recommend Eloquent JavaScript. It is written in a very human approachable way which will appeal to more people. Marijn Haverbeke's prose is easy to follow in the book and entertaining to read, unlike a technical reference manual (which I also like). Also the solution code provided truly lives up to its eloquent namesake.
