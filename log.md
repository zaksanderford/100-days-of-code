# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I've been working on the FreeCodeCamp curriculum since I caught wind of this challenge, but I will start couting today (5-Jan-17) as day 1.

### Day 1: 5-Jan-2017 (1030 - 1230 CST)

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp Basic JavaScript Exercises. Start: Build JavaScript Objects. End: Iterate with JavaScript While Loops

**Thoughts** I've come back to coding after a break. Some of the stuff is as fresh as they day I learned it, other things not so much. I got hung up on the Manipulating Complex Objects Exercise because *commas* separate *everything* in an object. Additionally, remembering how nesting loops work hung me up for a while on the Nesting For Loops exercise where the end goal was to get a product based on all the array elements, in multiple arrays. I will hopefully come back later today and work on the mini-project section [Profile Lookup](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/profile-lookup) to close up the objects and loops portion of the Basic JavaScript Exercises.

### Day 2: 6-Jan-2017 (0900 - 1020 1200-1215 CST)

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp Basic JavaScript Exercises. Finished: Profile Lookup and the rest of the Basic JavaScript Exercises

**Thoughts** You ever run in to a wall? That's what I did on the FreeCodeCamp Profile Lookup exercise, which I tried to tackle for a bit yesterday evening, and finally finished today. I knew logically how it needed to happen, but I could not translate the logic in my brain to logic that JavaScript would understand. I went on the [JavaScript Help](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/HelpJavaScript) gitter last night and got some help from @revisualize, but I couldn't make the final connection before I went to sleep last night. This morning, I tried several tacts (while loops, lookup array) and couldn't get it to work. On the JavaScript Help Gitter, someone has having the same problem that I was and I read through that persons code and their correspondence with another user and was able to find where I went astray, and where they went astray and was able to fix those two errors to complete my code. My thanks to them, unfortunately, I do not remember their user names, or I would mention them.

### Day 3: 7-Jan-17 (1930 - 2115 CST)

**Today's Progress**: Eloquent JavaScript Chapter 2 Programs

**Thoughts** Not a lot today. I was trying to make some repairs to my laptop, which went well until I tried to put it back together the 2nd time and the power button's connection on the main board came lose from its mainboard mount, so now I have to see if it is more cost effective to replace the mainboard or see if someone can do some surface mount soldering on that issue.

At any rate, I have been reading Eloquent JavaScript, and dove into the Chapter 2 programs this evening to keep current on program flows. The chapter 2 programs involved outputting [octothorpes](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/octothorpe) in a right triangle as follows

\#

\#\#

\#\#\#

\#\#\#\#
etc.

Also did the "FizzBuzz" program where you write a program that outputs Fizz for multiples 3 and Buzz for multiples of 5, FizzBuzz for numbers that are multiples of 3 and 5, and just the number for anything that did not meet those criteria.

The last program in chapter 2 was the chessboard problem wher you programatically get the console to out put "#" or " " in an alternating fashion over multiple rows *a la* a chess board. This is a program I had done in the past, but I couldn't remember how I had done it so it took me much longer to complete than I'd like to admit, but I got it done. This also served as a lesson, save your code snippets, no matter how insiginifcant, as they will provide a good resource for the stupid simple thing you forgot to do in your big program.

Lastly, so far, I can highly recommend Eloquent JavaScript. It is written in a very human approachable way which will appeal to more people. Marijn Haverbeke's prose is easy to follow in the book and entertaining to read, unlike a technical reference manual (which I also like). Also the solution code provided truly lives up to its eloquent namesake.

### Day 4: 8-Jan-2017 (2000 - 2100 CST)

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp Completed: Object Oriented and Functiona Programming, Started: Basic Algorithm Scripting

**Thoughts** Today I started and completed the OO and Functional Programming and tackled the first two problems in Basic Algorithm Scripting. I clearly need to increase my understanding of data objects in JavaScript as the OO and Functional program featured those heavily and some of the ideas are only clear as mud right now. I do look forward to putting together what I do know into the Basic Algorithm Exercises.

### Day 5: 9-Jan-2017 (0945 - 1145 CST)

**Today's Progress**: Eloquent JavaScript Chapter 3 Exercises and Free Code Camp Basic Algorithms: Factiorilze a Number, Check for Palindromes and Find the Longest Word in a String.

**Thoughts** Last night as part of a little light reading before bed, I read Chapter 3 in Eloquent JavaScript about Functions and this morning I worked through the exercises. It is interesting to write code that you would never write for a program. In this case the Recursion exercise wanted you to write a function that calls itself to determine whether or not a number is even. It took me a while figure out to make this a recursive function because I really wanted to write it non-recursively as it makes more sense in that context.

With the Free Code Camp Basic Algorithm exercises today, I had to remember that simple is usually better, and actually seing EJS' author's code samples thus far has helped me do that. Sometimes iteration doesn't need to happen and if you can understand string and array methods in JavaScript some of these Basic Algorithms can be solved in as few as one line.

Contestant A: "I can solve this problem in 2 lines"

Contestant B: "I can solve this problem in 1 line"

If you get the above reference, we will probably be fast friends.

### Day 6: 10-Jan-2017 (1000 - 1315 CST)

**Today's Progress**: Started and Complete FreeCodeCamp's Title Case a Sentence Exercise

**Thoughts** This has been the toughest exercise to date, but I completed it, and that's what we're after right. After many calls to ```console.log()``` to see what was working how in what I had coded, I was able to make more educated guesses as to what my program needed to do in order to complete the task at hand and eventually. At the start of my working solution I had about 7 - 8 lines of code inside a for loop and I was able to pare that down to 3 lines within the loop, plus some variable declaration and string parsing outside of the loop. I'm sure there is probably a better way of doing this, but I'm quite proud of this solution. If you have not used w3schools JavaScript Array and String reference pages, I highly recommend them as a way to see all the built-in functions that can be accessed to work with arrays and strings.

### Day 7: 11-Jan-2017 (1000 - 1130 CST)

**Today's Progress**: Completed: Confirm the Ending, Repeat a string repeat a string and Truncate a string

**Thoughts** Today went really well, I was able to complete three exercises in less time than it took me to complete one yesterday. That's the great thing about cumulative learning, once you figure out something difficult you can carry that knowledge forward with you and apply it to future problems.

### Day 8: 12-Jan-2017 (1000 - 1230, 1830 - 2030 CST)

**Today's Progress**: Completed: Chunky Monkey, Slasher Flick and Mutations

**Thoughts** Today was a mixed bag. I breezed through one exercise, struggled a little on another exercise, and struggled massively on another but not necessarily in that order. The *Chunky Monkey* exercise took me a little doing trying to get my iteration right. I originally tried to iterate on a value that was changing with every iteration, which produced some wonky (the technical term) results. The *Slasher Flick* took very little time, and occured quite on accident. I had to console log the results to see what was happening. Then *Mutations* happened. And it kept happening, and everytime I changed something, I'd get different results. At one point I met all the tests thrown at it, except the first one. I'd change ***one tiny little thing*** and everything except the first one would fail. It took me a while to wrap my head on the understanding of the ```string.indexOf()``` method. Once I wrapped my skull around that, things kept falling into place bit-by-bit, but it still took a ~~little~~ a lot of doing to get the desired result. I left all my console.log statements active so I can re-run the script and see what is going in to remember how things work with some of the more arcane string methods.

### Day 9: 13-Jan-2017 (1830 - 1930 CST)

**Today's Progress**: Completed: Falsy Bouncer

**Thoughts** It was a long day at work today. I usually work a split shift, but today was straight through with a field trip to San Antonio, but I was able to succesfully complete an algorithm exercise, so I'll call that a success.

### Day 10: 14-Jan-2017 (0830 - 0945 CST)

**Today's Progress**: Completed: Caesers Cipher and the FreeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting Exercises

**Thoughts** Today I completed Caesers Cipher exercise and also closed out the Basic Algorithm Scripting section of FreeCodeCamp. Next I will move forward through the JSON APIs and AJAX lessons and Intermediate Front End Projects. Yesterday, I also found out that a division of a company that I worked for in a different capacity in the past would like to do some remote data management work for them as the bring new systems online, so I am excited for that opportunity.

### Day 10: 14-Jan-2017 (0830 - 0945 CST)

**Today's Progress**: Random Quote Machine Functionally Complete

**Thoughts** I actually spent a good bit of yesterday working on the FreeCodeCamp Random Quote Machine and got to the point where the quotes were being correctly served from an API and laid out the skeleton for the Tweet button. When I called it a day yesterday, I had my tweet button logging to the console so that I knew that it had basic functionality.

Today I was able to finish the tweet button with appropriate functionality. Now I need to do a little styling work, which for me is difficult, because I don't have much of an eye for style.
