# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I've been working on the FreeCodeCamp curriculum since I caught wind of this challenge, but I will start couting today (5-Jan-17) as day 1.

### Day 1: 5-Jan-2017 (1030 - 1230 CST)

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp Basic JavaScript Exercises. Start: Build JavaScript Objects. End: Iterate with JavaScript While Loops

**Thoughts** I've come back to coding after a break. Some of the stuff is as fresh as they day I learned it, other things not so much. I got hung up on the Manipulating Complex Objects Exercise because *commas* separate *everything* in an object. Additionally, remembering how nesting loops work hung me up for a while on the Nesting For Loops exercise where the end goal was to get a product based on all the array elements, in multiple arrays. I will hopefully come back later today and work on the mini-project section [Profile Lookup](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/profile-lookup) to close up the objects and loops portion of the Basic JavaScript Exercises.

### Day 2: 6-Jan-2017 (0900 - 1020 1200-1215 CST)

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp Basic JavaScript Exercises. Finished: Profile Lookup and the rest of the Basic JavaScript Exercises

**Thoughts** You ever run in to a wall? That's what I did on the FreeCodeCamp Profile Lookup exercise, which I tried to tackle for a bit yesterday evening, and finally finished today. I knew logically how it needed to happen, but I could not translate the logic in my brain to logic that JavaScript would understand. I went on the [JavaScript Help](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/HelpJavaScript) gitter last night and got some help from @revisualize, but I couldn't make the final connection before I went to sleep last night. This morning, I tried several tacts (while loops, lookup array) and couldn't get it to work. On the JavaScript Help Gitter, someone has having the same problem that I was and I read through that persons code and their correspondence with another user and was able to find where I went astray, and where they went astray and was able to fix those two errors to complete my code. My thanks to them, unfortunately, I do not remember their user names, or I would mention them.

### Day 3: 7-Jan-17 (1930 - 2115 CST)

**Today's Progress**: Eloquent JavaScript Chapter 2 Programs

**Thoughts** Not a lot today. I was trying to make some repairs to my laptop, which went well until I tried to put it back together the 2nd time and the power button's connection on the main board came lose from its mainboard mount, so now I have to see if it is more cost effective to replace the mainboard or see if someone can do some surface mount soldering on that issue.

At any rate, I have been reading Eloquent JavaScript, and dove into the Chapter 2 programs this evening to keep current on program flows. The chapter 2 programs involved outputting [octothorpes](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/octothorpe) in a right triangle as follows

\#

\#\#

\#\#\#

\#\#\#\#
etc.

Also did the "FizzBuzz" program where you write a program that outputs Fizz for multiples 3 and Buzz for multiples of 5, FizzBuzz for numbers that are multiples of 3 and 5, and just the number for anything that did not meet those criteria.

The last program in chapter 2 was the chessboard problem wher you programatically get the console to out put "#" or " " in an alternating fashion over multiple rows *a la* a chess board. This is a program I had done in the past, but I couldn't remember how I had done it so it took me much longer to complete than I'd like to admit, but I got it done. This also served as a lesson, save your code snippets, no matter how insiginifcant, as they will provide a good resource for the stupid simple thing you forgot to do in your big program.

Lastly, so far, I can highly recommend Eloquent JavaScript. It is written in a very human approachable way which will appeal to more people. Marijn Haverbeke's prose is easy to follow in the book and entertaining to read, unlike a technical reference manual (which I also like). Also the solution code provided truly lives up to its eloquent namesake.

### Day 4: 8-Jan-2017 (2000 - 2100 CST)

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp Completed: Object Oriented and Functiona Programming, Started: Basic Algorithm Scripting

**Thoughts** Today I started and completed the OO and Functional Programming and tackled the first two problems in Basic Algorithm Scripting. I clearly need to increase my understanding of data objects in JavaScript as the OO and Functional program featured those heavily and some of the ideas are only clear as mud right now. I do look forward to putting together what I do know into the Basic Algorithm Exercises.

### Day 5: 9-Jan-2017 (0945 - 1145 CST)

**Today's Progress**: Eloquent JavaScript Chapter 3 Exercises and Free Code Camp Basic Algorithms: Factiorilze a Number, Check for Palindromes and Find the Longest Word in a String.

**Thoughts** Last night as part of a little light reading before bed, I read Chapter 3 in Eloquent JavaScript about Functions and this morning I worked through the exercises. It is interesting to write code that you would never write for a program. In this case the Recursion exercise wanted you to write a function that calls itself to determine whether or not a number is even. It took me a while figure out to make this a recursive function because I really wanted to write it non-recursively as it makes more sense in that context.

With the Free Code Camp Basic Algorithm exercises today, I had to remember that simple is usually better, and actually seing EJS' author's code samples thus far has helped me do that. Sometimes iteration doesn't need to happen and if you can understand string and array methods in JavaScript some of these Basic Algorithms can be solved in as few as one line.

Contestant A: "I can solve this problem in 2 lines"

Contestant B: "I can solve this problem in 1 line"

If you get the above reference, we will probably be fast friends.
